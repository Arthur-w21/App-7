Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to create a HTML5 drawing canvas that has a border and can fit on the screen of an iPhone. It will have 4 buttons. One will draw a rectangle on the canvas, one will put the users name on the canvas, one will load an image of the users choice, and one will clear the canvas when pressed.
